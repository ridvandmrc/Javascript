### Routing

- In Angular, it provides **routing-app** library.

`ng new routing-app`

### Defining a basic Route

- There are three fundemantal building blocks to creating a route.

### 1 - Set up a `Routes` array for our routes

- we should **include** Routes from `@angular/route`

```ts
import {} from "@angular/router";

export const routes: Routes = [];
```

### 2 - Define our routes in our `Routes` array

- Each route in this array **has to have** two properties.
- These are **path** and **component**.
- **path** is path of route.
- **component** is compnent when path is opened from browser

```ts
import {FirstComponent} from './first/first.component';
import {SecondComponent} from './second/second.component';

const route: Routes = [
    {path:'first-copmonent', component:FirstComponent}
    {path:'second-copmonent', component:SecondComponent}
];
```

### 3 - Add the `Routes` in the Module

```ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from "@angular/ApplicationConfig";

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes)],
};
```

### Displaying a 404 Page

- If the path is not in the our **route list**, that means that `404 not found`.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: "first-component", component: FirstComponent },
  { path: "second-component", component: SecondComponent },
  { path: "**", component: PageNotFoundComponent }, // Wildcard route for a 404 page
];
```

### Setting up redirects

- To set up a redirect, configure a route with the **path**
- we can do it by using **redirectTo**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: "first-component", component: FirstComponent },
  { path: "second-component", component: SecondComponent },
  { path: "", redirectTo: "/first-component", pathMatch: "full" }, // redirect to `first-component`
  { path: "**", component: PageNotFoundComponent }, // Wildcard route for a 404 page
];
```

### Nesting routes

- In our application we can need to have sub path like
  `main-domain/child-domain`
- we can provide this structure by using **chilren**
- Children is an **Array**, and also it has exactly same type with **Routes**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "first-component",
    component: FirstComponent, // this is the component with the <router-outlet> in the template
    children: [
      {
        path: "child-a", // child route path
        component: ChildAComponent, // child route component that the router renders
      },
      {
        path: "child-b",
        component: ChildBComponent, // another child route component that the router renders
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Setting the Page title

- Each Page should have a unique title so that they can be identified in the browser history.
- **Router** provide **title** attribute

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "first-component",
    title: "First component",
    component: FirstComponent, // this is the component with the <router-outlet> in the template
    children: [
      {
        path: "child-a", // child route path
        title: resolvedChildATitle,
        component: ChildAComponent, // child route component that the router renders
      },
      {
        path: "child-b",
        title: "child b",
        component: ChildBComponent, // another child route component that the router renders
      },
    ],
  },
];
const resolvedChildATitle: ResolveFn<string> = () => Promise.resolve("child a");
```

- we can use the **title** in the our application like:

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class TemplatePageTitleStrategy extends TitleStrategy {
  constructor(private readonly title: Title) {
    super();
  }
  override updateTitle(routerState: RouterStateSnapshot) {
    const title = this.buildTitle(routerState);
    if (title !== undefined) {
      this.title.setTitle(`My Application | ${title}`);
    }
  }
}
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes),
    { provide: TitleStrategy, useClass: TemplatePageTitleStrategy },
  ],
};
```

### Accessing query parameters and fragments

- Sometimes we need to use query paremeters like `id`.

```ts
heroes$: Observable<Hero[]>;
selectedId: number;
heroes = HEROES;
ngOnInit() {
  this.heroes$ = this.route.paramMap.pipe(
    switchMap(params => {
      this.selectedId = Number(params.get('id'));
      return this.service.getHeroes();
    })
  );
}
```

### Preventing `unauthorized` access

- Generally, we want to protect our **routes** so that **Angular provide** a function
  that name is `CanActivateFn`
- This function should return `boolean`, and also we can navigate other other page.

```ts
export const yourGuardFunction: CanActivateFn = (
  next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
  state: RouterStateSnapshot
) => {
  // your  logic goes here
};

// we can use canActivate in Routes like this.
{
  path: '/your-path',
  component: YourComponent,
  canActivate: [yourGuardFunction],
}
```
