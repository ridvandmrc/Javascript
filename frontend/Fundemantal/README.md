### storage:
***Browser Storage:***

    Browser storage is getting increase our performance that's why the major reason to use browser storage
     There are a few ways to store the data locally on our browser, and three of them are most popular.

***local storage:***
    
    * it help us to store date on client's computer.
    * it is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless user manually deletes it from browser.
    * it does not expire even if user close the browser window or tab.
    pros:
        * no-expiration date
        * about 10MB limit
        * never transferred to server
    cons:
        * plain text
        * string needs to be serialized
        * only client side not server 
***session storage:***

    * it is very similar to **localStorage**.
    * Major difference is that when you close the tab or terminate th session. the data also gets lost.

***cookie:***

    * Cookies help us store the client-side data with requests to the server and are sent to the client on response. (personalized experienced)

JS:
