## SELECTORS

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide **css selector** into five categories:

* **[Simple Selectors](https://github.com/ridvandmrc/Self-Learning/tree/main/css/selector/simple_selector)** (select elements based on name, id, class)
* **[Combinator Selectors](https://github.com/ridvandmrc/Self-Learning/tree/main/css/selector/combinator_selector)** (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
* **[Pseudo-class Selectors](https://github.com/ridvandmrc/Self-Learning/tree/main/css/selector/)** (select elements based on a certain state)
* **[Pseudo-elements selectors](https://github.com/ridvandmrc/Self-Learning/tree/main/css/selector/pseudo_elements_selector)** (select and style a part of an element)
* **Attribute selector** (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
