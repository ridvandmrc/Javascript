* **@use**: loads mixins, functions and variables from other Sass stylesheet, and combine CSS from  multiple sheets together.
* **forwards**: loads a style sheets and makes it mixins, function and variable available when our script load with **@use**.
* **import**: extends the CSS at-rule, function, mixin and variable from other stylesheet.
* **@mixin** and **@include**: makes it easy to re-use chunks of style.
* **@extends**: allow to inherit style from other stylesheet.
* **@at-root**: put the style to root of document
* **@error**:causes compilation error 
* **@warn**: give console warning without error or blocking
* **@debug**: print message for debugging process
* **@if, @each, @for, and @while**: are control mechanism
