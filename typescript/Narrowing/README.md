## Narrowing

Let's try to implement function called ***padLeft***.

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  throw new Error("Not implemented yet!");
}
```

If **padding** is a **number**, it will treat that as the number of spaces we want to prepend to **input**. If **padding** is a **string**, it should just prepend **padding** to **input**. Letâ€™s try to implement the logic for when padLeft is passed a **number** for **padding**.

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
  return " ".repeat(padding) + input;

/*Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'. */
}
```


* We will get an error,  because ***repeat*** is accepting number as a type but padding can be string.

* We can fix this issue by checking type of padding

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
  }
  return padding + input;
}
```

* this can be looked like interesting because it's looking completely JS code. special type checking called **type guard**.

* But types script can understand this check and create separate branch and declare it called ***narrowing***.

### ***typeof*** type guards

* "string"
* "number"
* "bigint"
* "boolean"
* "symbol"
* "undefined"
* "object"
* "function"

and also TS check nullable or not.

### The **in** operator narrowing

JS has an operator for determining  if an object has a property with a name. the **in** operator.

```ts
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
 
function move(animal: Fish | Bird) {
  if ("swim" in animal) {
    return animal.swim();
  }
 
  return animal.fly();
}
```

### ***Asssignments*** ###

When we assign to any variable, TS looks at the right side of the assignment and the left side appropriately.

![Narrowing Assignment](./img/assignment_narrowing.png "Assignment Narrowing")

Notice that each of these assignments is valid. Although the observed type of ***x*** changed to ***number*** after our first assignment. This is because the declared type of ***x*** - the type that ***x*** started with ***string | number***. 

let's try it out assign boolean.

## Using type predicates ###

If we want to control directly the type, to define a type-guard, we need to define a function hose return type is a ***type predicate***

```ts
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
```

For above function ***pet is Function*** is our type predicate. A predicate takes the form ***parameterName is Type***, where ***parameterName*** must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.


Anytime ***isFish*** called with some variable, TS will narrow that variable tÄ± specific type if the original type is compatible.

```ts
// Both calls to 'swim' and 'fly' are now okay.
let pet = getSmallPet();
 
if (isFish(pet)) {
  pet.swim();
} else {
  pet.fly();
}
```

Notice that TS no only knows that ***pet*** is a  ***Fish*** in the  ***if*** branch; it also knows that in the ***else*** branch, you don't have a ***Fish***, so we must have a ***bird***.

we may use the type guard ***isFish*** to filter an array ***Fish | Bird*** and obtain an array of ***Fish***:

```ts
const zoo: (Fish | Bird)[] = [getSmallPet(), getSmallPet(), getSmallPet()];
const underWater1: Fish[] = zoo.filter(isFish);
// or, equivalently
const underWater2: Fish[] = zoo.filter(isFish) as Fish[];
 
// The predicate may need repeating for more complex examples
const underWater3: Fish[] = zoo.filter((pet): pet is Fish => {
  if (pet.name === "sharkey") return false;
  return isFish(pet);
});
```
