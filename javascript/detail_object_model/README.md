## Details of the object model
JavaScript is an object-based language based on prototypes.

### Class-based vs. prototype-based languages
Class-based object-oriented languages.
* A class defines all off the properties that characterize a certain set of objects. A class is abstract rather than any particular member in a set of objects it describes.
* An instance, on the other hand, is the instatiation of a class.

A prototype-based language, such as JavaScript does not have  distinction: it has object.

Prototype based language has class and instance same. not distance.
